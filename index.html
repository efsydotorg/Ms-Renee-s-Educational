    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>EFSY.org is a faith-rooted instructional ministry operating under <strong>508(c)(1)(A)</strong> nonprofit status. We produce educational content specifically for our participants and deliver mastery-based instruction in STEM and music.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>We teach physics, math, music theory, and engineering logic using whiteboards, manipulatives, and digital tools. Our instruction is delivered through spontaneous field engagement, formal library sessions, and remote online teaching.</p>

    <h2>When & Where</h2>
    <p>Instruction takes place year-round in New York City libraries (Brooklyn Public Library and New York Public Library systems), public spaces, and online platforms. We are listed in tutoring directories and offer both scheduled and spontaneous sessions.</p>

    <h2>Why We Teach</h2>
    <p>We believe in mastery through authorship. Every lesson is designed to build trust, clarity, and procedural understandingâ€”especially for underserved learners and families.</p>
